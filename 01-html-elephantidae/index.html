<h1>Elephantidae</h1>
<p>Elephantidae is a family of large, herbivorous proboscidean mammals which includes the living elephants (belonging to
    the genera Elephas and Loxodonta), as well as a number of extinct genera like Mammuthus (mammoths) and
    Palaeoloxodon. They are large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks.
    Most genera and species in the family are extinct.<br>
    The family was first described by John Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within the
    order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to include or exclude other extinct proboscidean
    genera.
